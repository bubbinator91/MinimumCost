# TSP
This example shows how to use the MinCost class to implement a Traveling Salesman solver. It also includes a Python script that will allow you to view the data generated by the PHP file.

### TSP.php
This script has been tested to be functional on PHP v5.6.23. If you run this script by itself, it will generate 20 random X, Y based locations (with X <= 500 and Y <= 500), it will then generate the distances for all of the possible paths between the locations, then it will attempt to find the best route through the locations. After it is finished. It will output 2 files: 1) location_data.json, which is a JSON representation of all of the locations and all of the generated paths. 2) route.txt, which will contain the the IDs of the locations in the order of the best found route.

### TSPViewer.py
This script has been tested to be function on Python v2.7. While it is run from the command line/terminal, it won't work properly if you don't have some sort of graphical shell running. If you run this script, it will first check to see if the output files from the PHP script are present. If not, it will run the PHP script to generate the files. Then, it will read the files, and show a window containing a visual representation of the best route.

Here is a sample plot that was generated:
